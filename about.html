	<h2 class="main_text">Our History</h2>


	<div class="body_text">

		<p>Rice Electronics, aspiring to be the most innovative land mobile and marine electronics company, grew out of
			the
			experience and achievements of Bibbins and Rice Electronics. Mr. Bibbins and Mr. Rice founded the original
			company in 1957 when they realized a vital need in the offshore oil market. Developing several brand new
			innovative strategies to serve the increasing need of asset leasing as well as a need for reliable
			communications propelled Bibbins and Rice Electronics to the forefront of the offshore electronics market.
			Expanding their service, Bibbins and Rice Electronics soon became an industry leader in the offshore and
			marine
			markets with offices from Alabama to the Mexico border, employing some of the most talented sales and
			service
			technicians in the industry.</p>

		<p>David Rice, continuing in the spirit and determination of his father and Mr. Bibbins, founded Rice
			Electronics in
			1987. Since that time, Rice Electronics has increased its market share by innovative solutions in the land
			mobile, offshore oil rig camera surveillance systems, remote monitoring and control, marine shipping, marine
			GPS
			tracking, telephone PABX systems and many other areas of technology. Rice Electronics motto, “World Wide
			Innovative Communications Backed by Experience and Determination”, was born out of the hard work and
			perseverance that it took to make the company successful.</p>

		<p>With the changing markets of the new millennium, Rice Electronics embraces tomorrow’s challenges. Our sales
			and
			technical staff rise to meet the technical needs of every customer and endeavor to provide the best and most
			innovative electronic solutions industry can offer. Rice Electronics is here today and tomorrow providing

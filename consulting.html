			<h3>Consulting & Technical Support for Maritime Industry</h3>
			<p>
				Rice Electronics provides the best available technical support services to the industrial marine
				transportation and shipping industries. Our ISO 9001:2015 Certification (Texas location) certifies us to
				sell, install, repair, rent, and integrate marine navigation and maritime communication equipment as
				well as electronic industrial video systems. But while we sell a full array of cutting edge,

		<p> when other support and service providers and/or manufacturer factories are closed, who are you going to call? Call Rice Electronics, for we pride ourselves on providing “Oilfield Style” service and support – 365 days a year, 7 days a week, 24 hours per day – without fail, in any weather, and even on holidays – here in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as globally around the world.
		</p>

		<p>
			Because we consider ourselves a service organization first and foremost, our offices are strategically
			located geographically in Houston (ISO 9001:2015 certified), Morgan City, and Ciudad del Carmen, so that we
			can respond quickly to your local calls for technical assistance. Our products and services for oil well
			monitoring, communication, and security are more economical too, since we’re located near important
			oilfield-related areas along the Louisiana/Texas coast, you save money on mileage charges for our service
			calls. Each Rice Electronics location boasts several FCC-licensed, GMDSS -endorsed service technicians and
			ISO 9001:2015 compliant technicians from our Texas location, some with over 20 years experience. Each member
			of our technical support staff has the ability to provide service down to the component level on a wide
			spectrum of products covering a broad range of manufacturers.
		</p>

		<p>
			We always have our finger on the pulse of the oilfield services industry, which allows us to continue to
			offer an ever-growing array of oil well monitoring systems, oilfield security cameras, rig communication
			equipment, and more products and services. One such example of our flexibility can be shown by our
			World-Class System Integration and Configuration Services. Rice Electronics can create the optimum,
			configuration video systems featuring subsea TV units for real-time wellhead monitoring. All of our oil well
			monitoring systems can include our own World-Class System Integration and manufactured explosion-proof
			stainless steel monitor enclosures. We excel at providing telephone and PAGA oil rig communication systems,
			and can even provide DSL internet over the telephone system we install for you. But more than anything else,
			Rice Electronics can integrate all of your systems, increasing your rig systems’ overall efficiency and
			lowering your costs at the same time. Efficiency, economy, excellence, and expediency can always be expected
			with our oil rig monitoring services.
